Lady Frederica von Battenberg has baked a long, thin rectangular cake for her daughter Victoria. She has picked two random points on the top of the cake on which she has placed two candles. She hands the cake knife to Victoria, who now proceeds to pick a random point along the length of the cake, and cut across the cake at that point. Now that the cake has been cut in two, what is the chance that both pieces of the cake have a candel on them? (presumably Victoria does this blindfold and carefully).
